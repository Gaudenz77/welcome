# Welcome@Oppurtunity, Welcome Screen (Digital Signage)
## Project Task / Assignment 
* Create a digital signage used as "welcome-screen" and info-point, by creating a  webapp as <b>Vue.js-project</b>, using all useful Web-Dev-Techniques<br>(Html, Css, Js, Php, Bs5, [Github](https://github.com/Gaudenz77/welcome))
* Respect the contractually demanded design
----


## Performance criteria
### => To grant a complete as possible responsive app, I chose to include a Bootstrap-grid against clear client-wishes to achieve this behaviour
* UI implemented by design on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/JFmUjx8XLzAj9A4HUSGuZC/Opportunity-Welcome-Screen?node-id=1%3A2)
* API connection is working
* Responsive design improved => worked on
* Favicon replaced with Opportunity logo => worked on
* Alternative content shown if no entries available

## Usage: Welcome Screen
## => Use Firefox first, and if you use Chrome, when loaded, and layout is odd, reload the page!
* open the following Netlify-Link by clicking on it:
* ## [Krakatoom Welcomes You](https://krakatoomwelcomesyou.netlify.app/)
* See what up.
* Additional feature for category-filter using the dropdown
* Additional feature: Bootstrap5 inclusion

## Thank you for your time.
